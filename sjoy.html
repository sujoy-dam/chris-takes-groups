                                Cebu City, where we’ll spend the afternoon exploring Cebu’s best food market (Balut
                                anyone?) before wrapping up our journey with a farewell dinner. For our final night

                            <p>Upon booking, a £200 (or equivalent) deposit is required to secure your spot on the trip.
                                At this time, you can also pay for the trip in full. </p>
                            <p>Want to spread out your trip payments? We can split the cost across two payments, paid
                                120 days and 60 days before the trip departure date. Don’t worry, you don’t need to
                                remember these dates, we’ll be in touch when the payments are due. </p>
                            <p>To avoid debit or credit card fees, you can pay with direct bank transfer when you get to
                                the checkout.</p>
